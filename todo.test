3 )  i should save the result in the results table
4 )  i should provide a way to let them know which one is which while they are playing
5 )  add a functionality to the logout button in the match menu ( this will require me to add a new event to inform the other player that the first one has left the game and that ihe is the winner now )
6 )  i should create a new event in the challenge finished method in match controller to let the user know who won the game and get rid of some pictures

issues :
1 ) in the ( show questions ) > when i delete a question it deletes only the last question
2 ) in the ( show questions ) again  > when i refresh the page it looks like it is appending and not replacing > i should make sure it does this behaviour
3 ) when a third person enters while two students are already playing he should be redirected into the main menu with a message saying we don't offer this right now
4 ) fix the color of the green true icon that sometimes it is hard to see
5 ) from the database i should get only the first name if the user has put his full name
6 ) when the second player chooses his option no state image appears to him
7 ) make it only ten questions .
8 ) force the timer to stop when the player answers the question
9 ) force the timer to stop and disappear when the game finishes
10 ) make the questions counter slideup and slidedown when you move from a question to anther .
11 ) there is a new result added after the main result is recorded ( with the names null and null ) so there is a problem that should be solved
13 ) when i let both of the players forfeit , a skip of two questions happens and i still don't know why it happens
14 ) the questions counter doesn't work > so make it work
15 ) don't show the timer panel at the end of the game
16 ) i should let the questions counter counts after the new questions is shown not before
15 ) when you answer for the second time in the last moment it will count your answer
17 ) seems like the results are not calculated as it suppose to be ( when both players are equal or when both are negative )
18 ) the timer should disappear after you choose an answer ( try it > might be bad )
16 ) remove the first column from the results menu table
